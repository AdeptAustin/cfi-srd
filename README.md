# Classic Fantasy Imperative System Resource Document

Version 1.0, September 2023

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is an Open, ORC Licensed, version of the Mythras ruleset, focusing on dungeon exploration, high adventure, and tense encounters involving treasure, magic, and deadly foes. Classic Fantasy Imperative emulates the original thrill of the very first roleplaying game in the hobby but approaches it through the lens of the Mythras game system, which is 1d100 (or percentile) based, rather than using a d20.

This document offers a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, set of rules, including character creation, character races and classes, skills, rules for certain typical situations, combat, and magic – more than enough to get both players and Games Masters started, and form a solid basis for further development. _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is completely compatible with _Classic Fantasy Imperative_, the _Mythras_ core rules, and Mythras Imperative. Plus, it is also compatible with other ORC licensed percentile gaming systems.

## New to d100?

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ is a d100 or percentile system. Percentile dice, or 1d100, are used to resolve key actions – skill use, combat, magic casting, and so on. It is a roll-under system, meaning that the target number is expressed as a percentage (Athletics 65%, for instance), and both the Games Master and player are looking to roll equal to or less than this target number, using 1d100, to achieve a Success. It is quite easy to replace the 1d100 with a d20 if preferred, and all percentages can be divided by 5 (round up) to gain the target number for a d20 roll. Athletics 65% would become Athletics 13, in our example. However, 1d100 offers a great deal of flexibility and nuance that underpins the whole game, so our recommendation is to try the 1d100 approach first. While it may seem counterintuitive to have to roll _less_ than something (in many games, higher is usually better!), having a target number expressed as a percentage range that one needs to roll _within_ makes it easy and simple to see your chances of success, and allows for quite a few 'dice tricks,' such as Opposed Rolls, Criticals, and Fumbles, and a few other things explored later in these rules. Percentile roleplaying has been around for a long time and is a firmly established game system with a tried and tested core mechanic that is flexible, intuitive, and tends to fade into the background during play.

## Simplification

Long time owners of _Mythras_ and _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ will note that in some places the _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ rules have been simplified. This has been done so that a Games Master may more quickly introduce the game to new players with a minimum of fuss. Another area where _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ differs is in incorporating Imperial measurements instead of metric. Incorporating both takes up far too much room and would require multiple tables when dealing with Ranged Weapons and the like. The Imperial system was chosen simply to facilitate easier use of the countless battle mats already in existence, and to make converting adventures from other game systems that use Imperial measurements simpler. When filling out your Character Sheet, feel free to use the Conversion Tables in the Appendix, and whatever measurement system you find most useful and familiar.

## Rounding of Numbers and Results

On some occasions you will be required to divide numbers - typically the rating in a skill (such as for determining a Critical Success, which is 1/10th of the skill's value). Whenever a division result creates a fraction, always round up to the whole number. So, for instance, 1/10th of 64% is 6.4; this is rounded up to 7.

## Dice Used in the Game

_Classic Fantasy Imperative_ uses the standard polyhedral dice set: d4, d6, d8, d10 d12, d20 and d100. Additionally, the following dice are call for:

**d2:** Roll any die. An odds number equals 1 and evens equals 2. Or flip a coin.

**d3:** Roll a six-sided die; 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3.
