# Appendix: Conversion Tables

## Imperial Weights and Measures to Metric Conversion

To give _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ a cleaner presentation, make it easier to read, and condense descriptions and tables, _Classic Fantasy Imperative_ line will focus on Imperial measurements as opposed to both Imperial and Metric. Imperial was chosen to better facilitate conversion of existing material as most adventures, battlemats, and maps used by other games in the genre utilize the Imperial system. However, for those wishing to use the Metric System, the most commonly used weights and measures have been converted using the following table. Because we are not typically dealing with real-world creatures, spells, and so on, we can grant a little leeway in the weights and measures we've made up for them. Rather than using exact conversions, it is easier to use one that can be easily remembered, thus better facilitating game play.

| 0-10 | Calm | None | None |
| 11-20 | Moderate Breeze | None | None |

Wind, especially very strong winds, can have an adverse effect on activity. A wind's Strength (STR) is expressed in miles per hour of velocity. Its effect on physical skills – those involving STR or DEX – is detailed in the Skill column; effects on Movement Rate in the Movement Rate column (for example, a Light Gale of STR 40 reduces human walking speed to two thirds.

Temperature Table

| Fahrenheit | Type | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Below 2 | Glacial | Seek Immediate Warmth |
| 3-14 | Freezing | 15 Minutes |
| 13-32 | Cold | Hourly |
| 33-50 | Chill | Daily |
| 51-68 | Cool | - |
| 69-86 | Warm | - |
| 86+ | Hot | Hourly |

Temperate can vary dramatically due to climate, season, and elevation, depending on the campaign world and where scenarios are set. The above table provides a guideline for the effects of extreme temperature on characters.

Wearing suitable clothing permits a character a grace period of their CON in hours before exposure sets in, as shown in the Risk column. After this point they need to seek shelter or start to suffer Fatigue loss. Wet characters shift the Risk Rate one step cooler. Light or moderate gale force winds also shift Risk Rate by one step cooler, whilst strong gales and storms shift it two steps.
